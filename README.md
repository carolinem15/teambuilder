# Template Engine - Build your own office!

## Description

Template Engine is a command line application using Inquirer that renders your responses to a template and then generates an HTML using Fs. In your terminal, you are prompted by a series of questions that allows you to build an office to keep track of all your coworkers' information! This application also includes testing using Jest. The goal of this project was to apply what I had recently learned about class constructors and testing. I ended up with a much clearer understanding of how to create a successful class constructor. I also now feel confident that I can successfully interpret test feedback and change my code accordingly.

## Installation

To install this project, run node app.

## Usage

To use this project, follow the series of questions regarding your office members and notice that an HTML file gets generated in the output folder. Open this file in your browser to view your imaginary office!
